## Current roadmap

The current roadmap comprises of features that are planned for inclusion in a future
release of the Missive system.

### Remote deployments

* Image-based CAPTCHA device
* Double opt-in addition to a MailChimp subscriber list
* Support for XOAuth2 mail server authentication (e.g. for GMail)

### Local system

* HTML editor
* Required/optional field validation
* Type field validation
* Support for multiple forms per Missive account (would be useful for web agencies)
* Upgrade button (saves having to remove and re-deploy)
* Password strength meter for improved account security

## Future roadmap

The future roadmap represents ideas and suggestions that are being considered for
a future release. User feedback to support any of these specifically is welcome.

### Remote deployments

* SMTP retry (useful for the occasions when SMTP is configured and the email server
is unavailable at the time of sending)
* JavaScript rendering of the form (reduces reliance on PHP when rendering may be
better done in JavaScript anyway, e.g. in a Single Page Application)
* Send SMS messages from a form
* Send messages to a [Slack](https://api.slack.com/) chat
* Configurable rate-limiting
* Integrate [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html)

### Local system

* Scheduled automated tests for critical forms
