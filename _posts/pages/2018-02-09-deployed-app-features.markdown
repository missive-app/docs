This article lists the main features of the PHP-based remote app, and may be useful
for technical readers interested to know if it is suitable for their intended purposes.

* All the code you need to run a form-to-email on your own LAMP server
* Installs under remote control from the [Missive app](https://missive-test.jondh.me.uk/)
* Supports SMTP and Sendmail mail transfer
* SMTP sending includes support for standard SMTP and TLS or SSL encryption
* Messages are sent in an AJAX operation (may be helpful for Single Page Applications)
* All sections of the form can be overridden with custom HTML
* Optional rate-limiter to reduce third-party abuse
* Plenty of CSS classes/ids to which custom CSS can be attached

This list will be kept up-to-date as items in the
[Roadmap]({% post_url 2018-02-09-roadmap %}) are implemented.
