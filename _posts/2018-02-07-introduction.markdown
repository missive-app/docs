Welcome to the Missive project. The aim of this project is to give a simple way for
programmers and semi-technical users to configure and deploy a form to their PHP web
host and mail server in a relatively easy way. Deploying a simple form is completely
free of charge, and in due course, paid add-ons will be available to offer additional
functionality.

When a form is completed, one or more pre-defined emails will be sent from a configured
mail server. For example, a contact form can be set up so that an administrator gets a
copy of one message, and the form respondent gets a copy of another.

There are a number of solutions on the web for people who wish for a form to be hosted
for them, but this is to my knowledge the only service that will build and deploy it
on a site owner's own server.

Both SMTP and Sendmail mail sending protocols are supported. Software deployments can
be done via FTP or SFTP.

The interface for Missive is arranged into different tabs, and does not require
registration to be viewed. This allows prospective users more information about
the features offered before signing up.
