The roadmap is a list of improvements for the Missive system. It is split into
"current" and "future", where current improvements are more likely to be implemented
(though still not guaranteed).

If you see an idea and agree with it, feel free to let me know in the support channel.
Similarly, get in touch if you have your own suggestion.

## Current roadmap

The current roadmap comprises of features that are planned for inclusion in a future
release of the Missive system.

### Remote deployments

* Image-based CAPTCHA device
* Double opt-in addition to a MailChimp subscriber list
* Support for XOAuth2 mail server authentication (e.g. for GMail)

### Local system

* HTML editor (only text emails are supported currently)
* Required/optional field validation
* Type field validation
* Support for multiple forms per Missive account (would be useful for web agencies or
other folks who administrate a non-trivial number of forms)
* Upgrade button (saves having to remove and re-deploy)
* Password strength meter for improved account security

## Future roadmap

The future roadmap represents ideas and suggestions that are being considered for
a future release. User feedback to support any of these specifically is welcome.

### Remote deployments

* SMTP retry (useful for the occasions when SMTP is configured and the email server
is unavailable at the time of sending)
* JavaScript rendering of the form (reduces reliance on PHP when rendering may be
better done in JavaScript anyway, e.g. in a Single Page Application)
* Send SMS messages from a form
* Send messages to a [Slack](https://api.slack.com/) chat
* Configurable rate-limiting
* Integrate [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html)

### Local system

* Scheduled automated tests for critical forms
